							<h2>About Kelvin Ma</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Kelvin Ma is an undergraduate electrical engineering student at <a href = "https://www.ccny.cuny.edu"> The City College of New York</a>.
						During his time as an aspiring engineer, he has done extensive research in the field of artificial intelligence and game theory with <a href = "https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/m-%C3%BCmit-uyar">Professor Uyar.</a>
						The project was made possible by a grant provided by<a href = "https://www.army.mil/ccdc">The US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command.</a> The grant was provided through the <a href = "https://www.rfcuny.org/RFWebsite/">Research Foundation of the City University of New York.</a>
						 As a researcher, Kelvin has three publications to date.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to being a researcher with RFCUNY, Kelvin Ma also conducts research with <a href = "https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/samah-saeed">Professor Saeed</a> in the field of Quantum Computing at <a href = "https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/"> The City College of New York </a>.
					Using the <a href = "https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit Framework</a> and <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/technology/experience/"> IBM Q-experience </a> for quantum computing, he investigates the effects of quantum noise on machine learning, and graphing algorithms
				such as the support vector machine algorithm and the maxcut problem. </p>
						<p>Kelvin Ma is also the current Vice-President of the IEEE City College of New York Student Chapter where he develops and leads technical workshops, professional development events, and is currently
						developing a program to aid in the transfer process of prospective engineering students from other schools in <a href = "https://www.cuny.edu/"> City University of New York. </a> He also is the student representative for the Electrical Engineering Department during all
					faculty meetings within the <a href = "https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering"> Grove School of Engineering</a>.</p>
					<p> Most recently, Kelvin was made the Electrical and Computer Engineering Section Chief of the<a href = "https://www.hla.nyc/"> Harlem Launch Alliance </a>, a non-profit organization that promotes and competes in various collegiate rocketry programs/competitions. </p>
