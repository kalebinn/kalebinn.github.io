								<h3><a><b>Game Theory and Biology Inspired Flight Control for Autonomous UAVs Operating in Contested Environments</b></a></h3>
									<p>
										<b><i>Abstract</i></b> — A  self-organizing  swarm  of  autonomous  unmanned aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  can  provide  a  quick  response  to  cyber-attacks  in  austere  civilian  and  military  environments.  However, if  a UAV swarm  relies  on  centralized  control,  synchronization of  swarm  members,  pre-planned  actions  or  rule-based  systems, it  may  not  provide  adequate  and  timely  response  against  cyberattacks. We introduce game theory (GT) and biologically inspired flight  control  algorithms  to  be  run  by  each  autonomousUAVto  detect,  localize  and  counteract  rogue  electromagnetic  signal emitters.  Each UAV positions  itself  such  that  the  swarm  tracks mobile adversaries while maintaining uniform node distribution and  connectivity  of  the  mobile  ad-hoc  network  (MANET). UAVs use only their respective local neighbor information to determine their individual actions. Simulation experiments in OPNET show that our algorithms can provide an adequate area coverage over mobile  interference  sources.  Our  solution  can  be  employed  for civilian and military applications that require agile responses in dynamic  environments.

								<h3><b>AI and Game Theory Based Autonomous UAV Swarm for Cyber Security</b></h3>
									<p>
										<i><b>Abstract</b></i> — Uninterrupted communication is crucial for modern electromagnetic (EM) spectrum operations where successes of situational awareness,defensive and offensive missions depend on on-going control of a wireless spectrum. Preventing an adversary from dominating cyberspace becomes challenging as rapid technological developments allow state and non-state actors to engage in a broad range of destructive cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA). Digital threats to communication networks can range from eavesdropping and impersonation attempts to various forms of denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we present bio-inspired and game theory based ﬂight control algorithms for a swarm of autonomous UAVs. Each UAV considers MANET connectivity, overshadowed ground area coverage and signal strength from interfering mobile radio emitters. Our algorithms use 3D Voronoi tessellations and linear interpolation for EM mapping of local neighborhood as a part of decision making process. Simulation experiments in OPNET show that our algorithms can successfully guide autonomous UAVs while requiring limited near neighbor communications to provide a high percentage area coverage with an uninterrupted MANET connectivity. By providing a lightweight solution for rapidly deployable swarm of autonomous UAVs, our ﬂight control algorithms are good candidates for deployment in complex environments in presence of adaptive and mobile sources of EM interference.
